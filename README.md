# Oh Boid

This project is a small Three.js demo showing boid flocking behavior.

## Usage

1. Start a simple HTTP server in the repository directory. For example:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   or use any other static file server such as `npx serve`.
2. Open your browser at the shown address (typically <http://localhost:8000>) and load `index.html`.

The demo relies on CDN links for Three.js, so no additional installation steps are required.
